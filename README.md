# NopCommerce Playwright Test Automation

This project provides a **from-scratch Playwright test framework** to automate core user journeys on [nopCommerce demo site](https://demo.nopcommerce.com).

It supports running locally (with virtual environment) and inside Docker (CI/CD friendly).
The framework follows **Page Object Model (POM)**, generates HTML reports, captures artifacts (screenshot, video, trace), and is production-ready.
